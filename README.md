Live Demo: _Coming soon..._

---

**Animated Physics** is a lightweight, browser-based project built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The course explores sprite animation, interactivity, and physics simulation – showing how small details can transform a simple idea into a fun and polished game experience.

---

## 🎮 Features (planned & implemented)

- ✨ Sprite-based character animations (8-directional movement)
- ⚡ Simple AI for creatures – making the world feel alive
- 🧩 Collision detection & resolution to simulate real 2D physics
- 🎨 Randomised environments drawn with `drawImage`
- 🖱️ Mouse position tracking for responsive animation
- 🎛️ FPS control & time-based events
- 🔄 Restart button to reset the game state
- 📱 Runs directly in the browser – no frameworks, no libraries

---

## 📦 What You’ll Learn

- Build a browser game from scratch with **HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript**
- Apply **collision detection** to simulate physics
- Animate characters from sprite sheets & make them interact
- Implement **10 core game dev techniques** useful in any project
- Apply **OOP principles** in an interactive animation codebase
- Create **particle systems** to boost interactivity
